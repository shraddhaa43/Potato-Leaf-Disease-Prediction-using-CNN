# Potato-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-using-CNN
Welcome to the Potato Leaf Disease Prediction repository! This repository offers a comprehensive codebase for predicting potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Python. 
To facilitate the training and evaluation of the models, we have integrated the Kaggle dataset "Potato Leaf Diseases" into this repository. The dataset consists of a wide range of labeled images, encompassing healthy potato leaves as well as leaves affected by various diseases. You can access the Kaggle dataset from a given file in this repository.
The repository contains the entire code pipeline necessary for potato leaf disease prediction. This includes data preprocessing steps, the construction and training of the CNN model, and the evaluation of its performance. By training on the provided dataset, the CNN model becomes proficient at recognizing distinctive patterns and features associated with different types of potato leaf diseases.
The repository also includes a PowerPoint presentation that comprehensively explains the code and highlights the obtained results. This presentation serves as a valuable resource for gaining a deeper understanding of the implemented approach, the impact of different parameters, and the overall performance achieved by the model.
